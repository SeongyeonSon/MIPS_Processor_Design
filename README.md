# MIPS_Processor_Design
 Designed and implemented a 5-stage MIPS processor using Logisim, with distinct pipeline stages (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB).
Verified correct execution of R-type and I-type instructions through a set of test casesâ€”including arithmetic, branching, and memory access operations.
The test program includes instructions like nor, add, sub, slt, beq, lw, and sw, and was used to verify data/control flow through each pipeline stage.
Components such as instruction fetch (if), decode (id), ALU operations (Alu), and memory access (Mem) were modularized for clarity and scalability.
Developed as part of a computer architecture course at Hanyang University.
